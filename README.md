## Exobrain Project (National Strategic AI Project)  
**Link:** https://keai.kaist.ac.kr/projects/exobrain/  
**Project title:** WiseQA platform technology for human knowledge enhancement services  
**Funding source:** IITP (Government)  
**Duration:** 2013-06-01 – 2022-12-31  
**Key Areas:** Natural Language Processing; Knowledge Representation; Temporal Reasoning  

**Description:**  
Exobrain—an artificial “external brain”—was a decade-long collaboration (ETRI, Saltlux, KAIST) to develop world-class Korean AI technologies: deep QA for natural language questions, Korean text analysis, deep learning-based applications, and knowledge-based reasoning. Our lab’s contributions included extracting temporal information from Korean text and generating paraphrases and entailment to diversify question sets.

**Recent Topics of Interest:**  
- Temporal Information Extraction in Korean Documents  
- Question Entailment Generation via Paraphrasing

## Affective Virtual TA Project  
**Link:** https://keai.kaist.ac.kr/projects/affective-virtual-ta/  
**Project title:** Development of affective virtual TA service based on deep learning for foreign language education  
**Funding source:** KEIT (Government)  
**Duration:** 2020-07-01 – 2022-12-31  
**Key Areas:** Natural Language Processing; Affective Computing; Virtual Assistant  

**Description:**  
We developed “Edee,” an affective virtual teaching assistant platform for foreign language classes, leveraging real flipped-learning data. Edee offers four services: Social Tutor (ice-breaking activities), Personal Tutor (Korean language learning), School Life TA (schedule management), and Faculty TA (classroom group-mood analytics).

**Recent Topics of Interest:**  
- Grammar Correction  
- Virtual AI Assistant  
- Social Emotion Classification
