## Exobrain Project (National Strategic AI Project)  
**Link:** https://keai.kaist.ac.kr/projects/exobrain/  
**Project title:** WiseQA platform technology for human knowledge enhancement services  
**Funding source:** IITP (Government)  
**Duration:** 2013-06-01 – 2022-12-31  
**Key Areas:** Natural Language Processing; Knowledge Representation; Temporal Reasoning  

**Description:**  
Exobrain—an artificial “external brain”—was a decade-long collaboration (ETRI, Saltlux, KAIST) to develop world-class Korean AI technologies: deep QA for natural language questions, Korean text analysis, deep learning-based applications, and knowledge-based reasoning. Our lab’s contributions included extracting temporal information from Korean text and generating paraphrases and entailment to diversify question sets.

**Recent Topics of Interest:**  
- Temporal Information Extraction in Korean Documents  
- Question Entailment Generation via Paraphrasing

## Affective Virtual TA Project  
**Link:** https://keai.kaist.ac.kr/projects/affective-virtual-ta/  
**Project title:** Development of affective virtual TA service based on deep learning for foreign language education  
**Funding source:** KEIT (Government)  
**Duration:** 2020-07-01 – 2022-12-31  
**Key Areas:** Natural Language Processing; Affective Computing; Virtual Assistant  

**Description:**  
We developed “Edee,” an affective virtual teaching assistant platform for foreign language classes, leveraging real flipped-learning data. Edee offers four services: Social Tutor (ice-breaking activities), Personal Tutor (Korean language learning), School Life TA (schedule management), and Faculty TA (classroom group-mood analytics).

**Recent Topics of Interest:**  
- Grammar Correction  
- Virtual AI Assistant  
- Social Emotion Classification

## XR-based Police Training Platform  
**Link:** https://keai.kaist.ac.kr/projects/police-training-platform/  
**Project title:** XR counter-terrorism education and training testbed establishment  
**Funding source:** National Police Agency  
**Duration:** 2021-04-01 – 2025-12-31  
**Key Areas:** Speech Processing; Behavior Planning; Video Action Recognition  

**Description:**  
This project builds an XR-based education and training testbed to alleviate public anxiety in a rapidly changing security environment and enhance frontline police officers’ decision-making and response capabilities. We develop virtual training systems and advanced simulator environments for complex terrorism scenarios—complete with interactive, variable scenarios—and operate a mobile training platform to meet nationwide security needs. Our lab contributes specialized speech recognition and synthesis, along with real-time activity recognition from video feeds.

**Recent Topics of Interest:**  
- Automatic Speech Recognition Specialized in Police Domain  
- Text-to-Speech with Zero-Shot Voice Cloning  
- Real-Time Action Recognition of Trainees from Videos

## SMC Digital Pathology Consortium  
**Link:** https://keai.kaist.ac.kr/projects/smc-digital-pathology-consortium/  
**Project title:** Development of integrated analysis platform based on digital pathology data of high incidence cancer in Korea  
**Funding source:** Samsung Medical Center  
**Duration:** 2021-04-01 – 2025-12-31  
**Key Areas:** Semantic Segmentation; Image Classification; Explainable AI  

**Description:**  
We are creating an AI-based cancer analysis platform using high-resolution digital pathology data. Starting with neuroendocrine tumor grading classification, we integrate explainable AI to visualize model rationale, making deep learning insights clinically interpretable. We also develop segmentation tools to detect slide defects, reducing manual validation burdens, and propose methods for stable model training on giga-pixel images.

**Recent Topics of Interest:**  
- Image Classification/Segmentation for High-Resolution Images  
- Transfer Learning for Digital Pathology Data  
- Explainable AI in Medical Image Analysis
